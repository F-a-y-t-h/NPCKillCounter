[h1]NPC Kill Counter[/h1]

[h1]Need someone to help translate Chinese into English.[/h1]

[h2] Q&A: [/h2]
[h3] I remember that the original version has a monster killing count. Why do you still need your mod? [/h3]
The monster killing count in the original version is a general statistic based on the flag of NPC. For example, the red, yellow, blue and green Slim and even the King Slim are all classified as Blue Slim, which makes the count inaccurate.
This MOD is counted completely according to the unique ID of NPC. 1 is 1, 2 is 2, and the death count of each NPC can be calculated.

[h3] What are the visual effects? [/h3]
Modified the native monster killing technique prompt to display the [b]individual monster killing count/world total killing count[/b] of the NPC you last attacked.
However, it should be noted that although some NPCs are different, their names are the same. For example, zombies, torch zombies, etc. are called zombies.
Press alt (Favorites) to temporarily switch the display of NPC's unique ID. Note that it is in English, which is usually not used. It is only necessary to know why when the same name appears but the count goes up and down.

Note: Because there is no special hook compatible kill judgment, the two counts are slightly different. An individual dies after an attack, and the world is an item dropped by an NPC after a defeat. In contrast, an individual may deviate in some cases.
For example, Fargo's final BOSS will not be killed, so it will not be counted by individual monsters, but only by the world's total number. Ha ha ha! Unexpectedly, it will never be defeated!

[h3] Will it affect the original monster killing count? [/h3]

No, for example, the flag drop is calculated according to the original count. This MOD only visually blocks the original count and adds a new layer of count to display. The original statistics and flag drop are not affected.

[h3] Have you added developer functions? [/h3]
Yes, two Call interfaces are added, which is very simple. You can obtain and modify the count list of specific NPCs.
Refer to the source code for specific use https://github.com/zzp198/NPCKillCounter/blob/master/NPCKillCounter.cs#L10

At present, we have an idea that we can count the NPC according to the specific number to prevent cross phase BOSS challenges.
